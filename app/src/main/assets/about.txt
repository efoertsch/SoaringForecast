<p>SoaringForecast provides U.S. New England soaring forecasts, satellite images, and weather observations (METAR) and forecasts (TAF).</p>
<p>Soaring forecasts are from soargbsc.com/rasp/. Sounding locations can be displayed and when touched will display the skew-t diagram.</p>
<p>SeeYou turnpoint files from the Worldwide Soaring Turnpoint Exchange (http://soaringweb.org/TP/NA.html#US) can be imported, tasks created, and then a task can be overlaid on the the RASP forecasts. Alternately if you have a custom turnpoint file you use, you can place it in your device's Downloads directory and import it from there.</p>
<p> The first time you start the app a background task will run to download airport information from http://ourairports.com/data/.
 Once downloaded (you will receive a notification when complete), you can select the airports you would like to see METAR/TAFs. The METAR/TAF information comes from aviationweather.gov/
</p>
<p>Two types of satellite images can be displayed. The 'older' set (NOAA) also comes from aviationweather.gov.
 The second newer set(GEOS) comes from cdn.star.nesdis.noaa.gov. (Currently GEOS restricted to NE U.S.)</p>
<p>Go to Settings to change display of METAR/TAFs. You can also select options to show links to Dr. Jacks and SkySite. The links starts and displays the sites in separate web browsers.</p>
<p>The Windy forecast is from windy.com and adapted for the app. You can go to the full Windy site by clicking on the Windy icon on the Windy screen. </p>
<p>No warranties expressed or implied. Use at your own risk. If the forecast looks great but the day turns out to be sucky, any tow fees, retrieval fees, landout dinners, and/or broken gliders are on you.</>
